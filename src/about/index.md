# All about me

<div class="about-sections">

<div class="about-section" markdown="1">

## What I do

I work on interesting projects with interesting people. I write Javascript and use HTML and CSS to produce web applications for a variety of clients.

I am equally happy working at the front-end or back-end as long as I'm writing easy to use and easy to maintain code.

## How I work

I work with teams of devlopers and designers. Often working remotely, I use collaboration tools such at GitHub and Slack to stay on track.

I am a strong proponent of functional style programming and use this whereever sensible. Working with constantly evolving technologies allows for a fun and stimulating environment in which to innovate.

## Projects

I've been very lucky to work with clients on interesting projects.

I work on projects for live television including sports, elections, and news and weather. These are always very visual affairs and have a need for high availability and constistency.

I work on internal data and training apps for companies to keep staff up-to-date. Often used on mobile devices with lots of video these must be performant if they are to be useful.

## Writing

When time allows it's nice to share the things you've discovered.

I like to write about functional-style programming as it's an extremely powerful aspect of Javascript. It's also nice to play around with stuff that's not work-related to remind yourself it's not all web forms.
